# Likes

Objective of **Project #015: Likes**: is to use `onclick` events and `querySelector` to add like functionality on the website below:


## Web page Responsiveness

In this project, I've experimented with modern CSS to achieve web page responsivess for different screen sizes:

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/imgs/likes-webpage-responsiveness-demo.gif" height="300px">
</div>

## Like Funcionality

The `likePost()` function allows users to interact with the web page by liking individual posts, and it updates the displayed like counts dynamically when the user clicks the "Like" button for a post. The code demonstrates a basic example of handling user interactions in a web page using JavaScript.

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/imgs/likes-demo.gif" height="300px">
</div>
