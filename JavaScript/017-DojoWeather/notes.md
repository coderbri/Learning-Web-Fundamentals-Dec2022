# Extended Description of Functions in script.js

1. `loading()`: This function displays an alert with the message "Loading weather report..." when called. It is typically used to inform the user that some process is ongoing.

2. `accept()`: This function removes the `cookieDiv` element from the DOM when called. It appears to be related to accepting a cookie policy, and when the user accepts it, the popup is removed from the screen.

3. `celsiusToFahrenheit(temp)`: This function takes a temperature value in Celsius (`temp`) as an argument and converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula `(9 / 5) * temp + 32`. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number using `Math.round()`.

4. `fahrenheitToCelsius(temp)`: This function takes a temperature value in Fahrenheit (`temp`) as an argument and converts it to Celsius using the formula `5 / 9 * (temp - 32)`. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number using `Math.round()`.

5. `convertTemperatures(element)`: This function is responsible for converting temperatures displayed on the web page between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on the value of the `element`. It accepts an `element` as an argument, which is typically a dropdown or select input that allows the user to switch between temperature units. Inside the function:
    - It logs the current value of the `element` to the console.
    - It iterates through temperature elements on the web page, identified by IDs like `#temp1`, `#temp2`, etc.
    - For each temperature element, it extracts the current temperature value as a string and converts it to a number using `parseInt()`.
    - Depending on the value of `element` (which represents the selected temperature unit), it either converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa using the `celsiusToFahrenheit()` or `fahrenheitToCelsius()` functions.
    - The converted temperature is then updated in the DOM by setting the `innerText` of the respective temperature element.

Overall, these functions are used for loading messages, handling cookie acceptance, and converting temperature units displayed on the web page based on user preferences.
